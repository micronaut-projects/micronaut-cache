Dependent on the environment or when testing it might be undesirable to actually cache items.
In such situations a no operation cache manager can be used that will simply accept any items into the cache without actually storing them.

Add the Micronaut no operation cache module as a dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.cache:micronaut-cache-noop:{version}[]

The no operation cache manager needs to be enabled explicitly:

[source,yaml]
----
noop-cache.enabled: true
----
