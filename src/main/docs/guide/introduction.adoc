This project brings additional cache implementations to Micronaut.

To get started, you need to declare the following dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut:micronaut-runtime[]

NOTE: The configuration implementations in this module require at least Micronaut version 1.3.0. Each implementation is a separate dependency.

To use the `BUILD-SNAPSHOT` version of this library, check the
https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#usingsnapshots[documentation to use snapshots].
