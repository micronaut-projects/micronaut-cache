The following cache annotations are supported:

- link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/annotation/Cacheable.html[@Cacheable] - Indicates a method is cacheable within the given cache name
- link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/annotation/CachePut.html[@CachePut] - Indicates that the return value of a method invocation should be cached. Unlike `@Cacheable` the original operation is never skipped.
- link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/annotation/CacheInvalidate.html[@CacheInvalidate] - Indicates the invocation of a method should cause the invalidation of one or many caches.

By using one of the annotations the api:cache.interceptor.CacheInterceptor[] is activated which in the case of `@Cacheable` will cache the return result of the method.

If the return type of the method is a non-blocking type (either link:{jdkapi}/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture] or an instance of rs:Publisher[] the emitted result will be cached.

In addition if the underlying Cache implementation supports non-blocking cache operations then cache values will be read from the cache without blocking, resulting in the ability to implement completely non-blocking cache operations.
