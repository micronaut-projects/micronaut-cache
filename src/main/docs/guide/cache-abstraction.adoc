Similar to Spring and Grails, Micronaut provides a set of caching annotations within the link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/package-summary.html[io.micronaut.cache] package.

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/CacheManager.html[CacheManager] interface allows different cache implementations to be plugged in as necessary.

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/SyncCache.html[SyncCache] interface provides a synchronous API for caching, whilst the link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/AsyncCache.html[AsyncCache] API allows non-blocking operation.
