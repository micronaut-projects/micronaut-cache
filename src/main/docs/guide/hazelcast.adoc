https://hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast] caching is supported. Micronaut will create a Hazelcast client instance to connect to
an existing Hazelcast server cluster.

Add the Micronaut Hazelcast module as a dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.cache:micronaut-cache-hazelcast:{version}[]

The minimal configuration to use Hazelcast is to simply declare `hazelcast:` with a network configuration for addresses of the
Hazelcast cluster (example below).

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network-config: ['121.0.0.1:5701']
----

When using the link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/annotation/Cacheable.html[@Cacheable] and other Cache Annotations, Micronaut will create
the Hazelcast client and use the underlying https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/IMap.html[IMap] Cache Datastore
on the server.

The full list of configuration options is below:
