https://hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast] caching is supported. Micronaut will create a Hazelcast client instance to connect to
an existing Hazelcast server cluster or create an standalone embedded Hazelcast member instance.

NOTE: This module is built and tested with Hazelcast {hazelcastVersion}

Add the Micronaut Hazelcast module as a dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.cache:micronaut-cache-hazelcast[]

You can also add Hazelcast module to your project using cli feature as below:

[source,bash]
.Create a Micronaut application with Hazelcast module
----
$ mn create-app hello-world -f hazelcast
----

The minimal configuration to use Hazelcast is to simply declare `hazelcast:` with a network configuration for addresses of the
Hazelcast cluster (example below).

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    addresses: ['121.0.0.1:5701']
----

If you provide a Hazelcast configuration file (ex.: `hazelcast.xml`, `hazelcast.yml`, `hazelcast-client.xml`, or `hazelcast-client.yml`) in the working directory or classpath, Micronaut will use this configuration file to configure Hazelcast instance.

When using the link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/annotation/Cacheable.html[@Cacheable] and other Cache Annotations, Micronaut will create
the Hazelcast client and use the underlying https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/IMap.html[IMap] Cache Datastore
on the server.

The full list of configurable options is below.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.cache.hazelcast.HazelcastClientConfiguration.adoc[]

For settings not in the above list, a https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener] can be registered for
link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/hazelcast/HazelcastClientConfiguration.html[HazelcastClientConfiguration] or link:{api}/io/micronaut/cache/hazelcast/HazelcastMemberConfiguration.html[HazelcastMemberConfiguration]. The listener will allow all properties to be set directly on the configuration instance.

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class HazelcastAdditionalSettings implements BeanCreatedEventListener<HazelcastClientConfiguration> {

    @Override
    public HazelcastClientConfiguration onCreated(BeanCreatedEvent<HazelcastClientConfiguration> event) {
        HazelcastClientConfiguration configuration = event.getBean();
        // Set anything on the configuration
        return configuration;
    }
}
----

Alternatively, the `HazelcastClientConfiguration` or `HazelcastMemberConfiguration` bean may be replaced with your own implementation.

To disable Hazelcast:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  enabled: false
----
