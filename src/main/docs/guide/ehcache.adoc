To use https://www.ehcache.org/[Ehcache] as the caching implementation, add it as a dependency to your application:

NOTE: This module is built and tested with Ehcache {ehcacheVersion}

dependency:io.micronaut.cache:micronaut-cache-ehcache[]

To have Micronaut create a cache, the minimum configuration is:

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  caches:
    my-cache:
      enabled: true
----

Then, you can use any of the caching annotations with `my-cache` as cache name.

See the configuration reference to check all possible configuration options.

== Tiering options

Ehcache supports the concept of https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.8/tiering.html[tiered caching]. This library
allows you to configure tiering caching options on a per-cache basis.

If no tier is explicitly configured, the cache will be configured with a heap tier of 100 entries maximum.

=== Heap tier

It can be sized by number of entries:

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  caches:
    my-cache:
      heap:
        max-entries: 5000
----

Or by size:

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  caches:
    my-cache:
      heap:
        max-size: 200Mb
----

=== Off-heap tier

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  caches:
    my-cache:
      offheap:
        max-size: 1Gb
----

Do not forget to define in the java options the `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` option, according to the off-heap size you
intend to use.

=== Disk tier

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  storage-path: /var/caches
  caches:
    my-cache:
      disk:
        max-size: 10Gb
----

=== Clustered tier

Ehcache supports distributed caching with http://www.terracotta.org[Terracotta]

This is a complete example configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  cluster:
    uri: terracotta://localhost/my-application
    default-server-resource: offheap-1
    resource-pools:
      resource-pool-a:
        max-size: 8Mb
        server-resource: offheap-2
      resource-pool-b:
        max-size: 10Mb
  caches:
    clustered-cache:
      clustered-dedicated:
        server-resource: offheap-1
        max-size: 8Mb
    shared-cache-1:
      clustered-shared:
        server-resource: resource-pool-a
    shared-cache-3:
      clustered-shared:
        server-resource: resource-pool-b
----

=== Multiple tier setup

A cache can be configured with multiple tiers. Read the
https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.8/tiering.html#multiple-tier-setup[Ehcache documentation] on the valid configuration
options.

For example, to configure a heap + offheap + disk cache:

[source,yaml]
----
ehcache:
  storage-path: /var/caches
  caches:
    my-cache:
      heap:
        max-size: 200Mb
      offheap:
        max-size: 1Gb
      disk:
        max-size: 10Gb
----
